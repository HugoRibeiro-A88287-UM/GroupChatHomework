NOTE: 
    This tutorial is to use raspberry pi 4 as a server. All the makefile was done to that purpose. 
    If you want to have your PC as client and server, all you need to do is to change the compiler
    for the server.

a ssh connection. It's also possible to use UART connection. 
That option won't be approached here.

* In PORT and IP put the raspeberry IP and the PORT you want to use

* Type make transfer_server to send the executable to the raspberry;

* Start executing the server on raspberry with the port number.

* Start communicate with your friends :)
